## Randomization

-   When subjects are assigned to one of several groups with help of a random device we call this random allocation.
-   This is useful not because this "balances" the group with respect to known covariates
-   Instead, it insures that the expected outcome of the two groups would be the same, if they were to receive the same treatment
    -   If this is the case, we call the groups exchangeable

The fundament of causal inference rests is not balance, but exchangeability of the treatment groups

## Notation

-   $\small Y^a$: The *potential outcome* (not observed) under treatment $\small a$
-   $\small Pr[Y = 1| A = 1]$: The proportion of cases with the *observed outcome* 1, among those with the *observed treatment* 1.
-   $\small Pr[Y^a = 1| A = 0]$: The proportion with the *potential outcome for treatment* $\small a$ being $\small 1$ , among those with the *observed treatment* 0.

## Exchangebility

If we want to estimate the effect $\small A \rightarrow Y$ as

$$\small \textrm{Effect} = Pr[Y = 1| A = 1] - Pr[Y = 1| A = 0]$$

This requires that the *potential outcome* of treatment $\small a$, $Y^a$, is equal for those *observed* with ($\small A=1$) and without ($\small A=0$) treatment.

$$\small Pr[Y^a=1|A=1] = Pr[Y^a=1|A=0]$$ ![](Skjermbilde.PNG){fig-align="center" width="479"}

## Exchangebility

If the potential outcomes are the same irrespective of the observed treatment ($\small Pr[Y^a=1|A=1] = Pr[Y^a=1|A=0]$), they are independent

$$Y^a \perp A$$

If the potential outcomes are independent of the treatment, we say the the treatment and the control group are *exchangeable* (wrt. to the potential outcomes) or that the treatment is *exogenous*.

## Exchangebility

-   is an assumption that we need to calculate treatment as $ATE$s
-   if we can justify this assumption, we can calculate treatment effects as the difference in the average outcome of the treated and the untreated.
-   the assumption cannot be verified, but randomization produces exchangeability
